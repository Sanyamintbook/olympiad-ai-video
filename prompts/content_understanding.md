You are an educational curriculum expert.

Analyze the provided educational content carefully.

Chapter Title:
{title}

Educational Content:
{content}

Identify the main topic, chapter title, major topics, subtopics, definitions, examples, learning objectives, and a concise summary.
Use the section headings from the source text to build a unified, high-level curriculum outline.
Maintain a strict hierarchy: Chapter Title -> Major Topics -> Subtopics. 

**YOUR ANALYTICAL APPROACH (MENTAL MODEL):**
To achieve the perfect balance of detail, you must act as an **Expert Master Tutor** designing a comprehensive, multi-day curriculum.
1. **The Goldilocks Granularity (Intermediate):** Your subtopics must not be too broad (e.g., "Minerals") and they must not be too fragmented (e.g., "Bauxite in Maharashtra"). Instead, find the perfect intermediate teachable concept (e.g., "Distribution and Uses of Bauxite").
2. **Break Down Large Sections:** If a textbook section is massive (e.g., "Important Minerals"), break it down logically (e.g., "Iron Ore and Copper", "Mica and Manganese").
3. **Group Fragmented Facts:** Never extract isolated sentences or single facts as their own subtopic. Group them into cohesive slides.

**CRITICAL RULES FOR EXTRACTION:** 
1. **TUTOR-LEVEL SUBTOPICS:** Your `subtopics` array MUST represent perfectly sized, teachable chunks. Each subtopic should contain enough material to fill a 1-minute explanation.
2. **EXTRACT ALL CORE CONCEPTS:** Do not skip important sections, but synthesize them elegantly. (Aim for roughly 15 to 25 perfectly balanced subtopics for a standard chapter).
3. **ESSENTIAL DEFINITIONS ONLY:** Extract only the most critical, foundational definitions.
4. **REPRESENTATIVE EXAMPLES ONLY:** Extract only the most overarching, representative examples.
5. **FOCUS ON CONTENT:** Include only the core educational text, conceptual explanations, and definitions, omitting extraneous noise like picture captions, recap lists, and chapter-end exercises.
6. **INCLUDE INTRODUCTIONS:** ALWAYS add "Introduction to [Chapter Name]" as the very first subtopic.
7. **FOCUS ON SUBJECT MATTER:** Include only the core academic content, explanations, and definitions. Omit any assessment elements such as exercises, recap lists, questions, "let's recall", fill in the blanks, test sheets, matching exercises, or project works.
8. The provided text may contain multiple chapters, paragraphs, or an entire book. You MUST process and include ALL information from the ENTIRE text. Synthesize a broad "chapter_title" that represents the whole document.
9. Return valid JSON only. Do not invent facts or add narration.
10. **CRITICAL (JSON DICT ONLY):** You MUST output ONLY a single JSON dictionary object (`{{}}`). Do not wrap it in anything else. Failure to return a valid JSON dictionary will completely break the system.
